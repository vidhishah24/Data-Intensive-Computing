That day Crystal Palace ruined Gerrard's send off. No respect whatsoever

Wouldn't mind if it was Suarez, Gerrard or someone world class the club had ostracised. But it's Sakho. A 28 year old french CB.
Wonder what Coutinho must be thinking?he could turn out to be Gerrard you know, choosing stay and not win anything despite bein quality #LFC
@Jess_Humphrey7 It dose but you have to give them a sniff of the success and Gerrard did and see if they take it with both hands
